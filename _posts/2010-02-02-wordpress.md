I spent most of the day today installing wordpress on the site and converting the old content to work on it.  

It's pretty much ready to go as-is, but I'm sure it will need the occasional tweak.  The purpose for this change is so I can document my projects as I work on them.  It might be confusing because [http://drogers.net/blog](http://drogers.net/blog) goes to my tumblr, and I'll keep it that way for the sake of old links, but the site itself will be an actual log of my activity, while the tumblr has always been merely an aggregation of things I find worth sharing.
