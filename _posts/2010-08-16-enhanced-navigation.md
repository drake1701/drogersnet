This is a project I'm working on for my current employer, [Storefront Consulting](http://storefrontconsulting.com).  

The client requested we modify the core Magento category filtering to allow for several features unavailable in the core version of Magento Enterprise.  They wanted to be able to apply multiple options under the same filter, and make the options available throughout the site, not just in the catalog module.

Here are some screen shots from the demo version with test products.

Here's the template for non-catalog pages:

![Site Wide]({{ site.url }}images/2010/08/4771959_aa41.png)

And here's the template for catalog pages and the "view all" category page:

![View All]({{ site.url }}images/2010/08/4771980_8761.png)
